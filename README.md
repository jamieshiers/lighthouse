# Project Lighthouse

### Executive Summary

This project is to help drive Guest Experience, Guest Issue Resolution, and Revenue onboard Cunard and P&O Cruise Ships. Using a centrally managed system (Ship and Shore) will drive greater collaboration between the office and ship, reducing the amount back-office tasks that Officers have to complete onboard, ensuring that they can focus on delivering unforgettable holiday happiness whilst maintaining brand standards and reporting is completed effectively. 

## Changes to ways of working

### CUK Staff at Carnival House

Those staff involved in the planning of the upcoming cruises (Entertainment, Revenue, and Guest Events), will have access to the system. 

#### Entertainment
The system would grant Entertainment bookers the ability to book the correct venues based on contractual agreements, manage guest entertainers images and spiels and also the ability to review a cruise's planned entertainment schedule once planned by the Assistant Entertainment Manager. 

#### Revenue Departments
To Follow


#### Guest Events
Guests often want to plan Weddings, special events or other gatherings onboard.  The shore event coordinator would be able to view venue availability for the requested date, make a provisional booking, take all the details from the guest and send all the details to the ship for approval. This greatly simplifies the current process.
